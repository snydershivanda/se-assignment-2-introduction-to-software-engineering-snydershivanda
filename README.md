Advantages of Agiles methodology include, quick response to change, regular customer feedback and improved team collaboration.
Disadvantages of Agile is less predictability and requires significant customer involvement.
Advantages of waterfall methodology; has clear structure and documentation and its easy to manage due to its rigidity.
Disadvantages of waterfall is that it is difficult to accommodate changes and testing occurs late in the process.
waterfall methodology is preferred in short-term projects whereas Agile methodology is preferred for long-term projects.

Requirements Engineering:


What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirement engineering is a software development life cycle phase that involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
the importance of requirement phase is that you get to understand the problems to be solved and you are able to design a system which offers the solutions

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down a software system into separate, self-contained modules or components. Each module is responsible for a specific set of functionalities and they interact with each other through a well-defined interface.
The following is how modularity can improve maintainability and scalability of software systems;
1. Isolation of concerns: modularity helps in isolating different concerns or aspects of a software system within separate modules. this makes it easier to understand, modify and debug the codebase.
2. Code Reusability: With modularity, developers can create modules that are self-contained and loosely coupled, making them easier to reuse in other parts of the system or in different projects. this reusability reduces redundancy and saves development time.
3. Ease of Testing: Modular code is easier to test because individual modules can be tested independently. unit testing can be more effective when each module is tested in isolation, ensuring that changes do not break other parts of the system.
4. Scalability: Modularity allows software systems to scale more easily. when new features need to be added or existing features need to be modified, developers can work on individual modules without affecting the entire system. this makes it easier to extend the functionality of the system without disrupting the existing codebase.
5. Parallel Development: Modularity enables parallel development by allowing teams to work on different modules simultaneously speeding up the overall development process.
6. Maintenance and Updates: When a software system is modular, maintaining and updating it becomes more manageable. Changes can be localized to specific modules. This makes it easier to fix bugs, add new features, or upgrade libraries without affecting the entire codebase.
7. Enhanced Collaboration: Modularity encourages collaboration among developers as modules can be developed, tested and maintained independently. Developers can focus on specific modules they are responsible for, leading to better organization and more efficient teamwork.

   
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing is the process of testing individual units or components of a software application in isolation. Focuses on verifying that each unit of the software code functions correctly as designed. Its main goal is to validate the correctness of the smallest unit of software.
Integration testing involves testing the interactions between different units or components of a software system. It ensures that the integrated components work together as expected.
Acceptance testing is performed to determine whether the software meets the requirements and expectations of the stakeholders. It is focused on validating the overall functionality, usability and performance of the software.
Testing is crucial in software development for various reasons such as:
- Identification of bug and defects in the software early in the development process allowing them to be fixed before the software is released.
- Ensures software meets quality standards and functions as intended.
- helps mitigate the risk associated with software development by identifying issues that could impact the usability, performance or security of the software.
- Customer satisfaction, testing ensures that the software meets the requirements and expectations of the stakeholder.
- Cost-effectiveness is achieved by identifying and fixing defects early in the development process than addressing them after the software has been released.


Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
